/*
Cluster module for 
Implementing Vertical scaling in Node.js project
You can start multiple node projects then? If there are 8 cores, then just start 8 projects?
 This, ofcourse has a lot of problems
 Just ugly to do this, keep track of the processes that are up and down
 Processes will have port conflicts, youâ€™ll have to run each process on a saparate port
